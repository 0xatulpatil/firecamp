# Firecamp is an Open-source Multi-protocol API development platform, for developers.

- VSCode-driven Developer Experience
- End to End testing of Rest, GraphQL, Websocket and SocketIO APIs
- Collaborate on API collection across the team
- Build APIs faster without switching between tools and apps. 

## Demo
https://dev.firecamp.io

## Features 
We give you a broad range of features that will help you build APIs faster than ever.

**Account**:  Create your Firecamp account with [Github], [Google], and Email and sync your data across devices and the cloud.

**Collection**: Collect and organise your APIs through the “collect and folder” feature.

**Workspace and team collaboration**: Firecamp allows you to create personal and team workspaces according to your needs. You can create a team workspace and collaborate with unlimited team members for better API development flow.

**Environment variables**: You can create environment variables to access and reuse values in the request, collection and workspace.

**History**: Access previously sent requests with one click.
**Proxy** :
**SSL** :
The setting will help you save your account information, local theme and other information.


## Dedicated GUI clients and playground for each API architecure style

**HTTP playground**
It's the light-weight, IntelliSense, and the next-generation testing client to give the most delightful collaborative experience while building APIs in a team.

## Getting the most of Firecamp
Documentation

See the Firecamp doc for in-depth walk-throughs on functionality. Join our Discord server if you need help, want to chat, or are thinking of a new feature. We're here to help - and to make Firecamp even better.

## Philosophy
The decentralization of tools, processes and people creates friction in API development workflow and frustration across the team. Developers are constantly switching between tools, searching for information, and wasting time due to inefficient tools.
We believe that the existing solution lacks both world-class experience and the simplicity needed to build APIs faster. This leads to a decrease in developer productivity, slow release times, and poor team collaboration.
We are bringing the VS code philosophy to Firecamp to solve this critical problem. Our mission is to build the most extensible, minimal and best developer experience API platform where developers feel most productive while building APIs.

## What's cool about this?

Firecamp is the world's first open-source API platform, which offers end-to-end testing and development of Rest, GraphQL, WebSocket, and many other APIs.
We're an OSS alternative to the Postman, Insomania. Designed to be more developer friendly and extensible in architecture, we are protocol agnostic.
We support major API specifications and protocols, which allows for seamless API testing, API documentation, and smoother collaboration between backend, frontend, and mobile teams.
