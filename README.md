## API Playgrounds
There is a dedicated GUI playground for each API protocol you would be using for your stack.

### :maple_leaf: **Rest Playground**
It's the lightweight, IntelliSense, and next-generation testing client to give the most delightful collaborative experience while building APIs in a team.

### :cherry_blossom: **GraphQL Playground**
Perform GraphQL operations with a seamless experience. Prepare, Share, and Export your Query Collection collaboratively with your team.

### :hibiscus: **WebSocket Playground**
Debug bidirectional connection visually with WebSocket GUI client more precisely now. The only GUI client to test, debug, and visualize real-time or event-driven messages collaboratively.

### :sunflower: **SocketIo Playground**
Monitor each emitter‚Äôs and listener‚Äôs events visually over a bi-directional SocketIO connection. It enables you to collaborate with the team over a SocketIO event-driven API build.

## Roadmap 
  Here is the Firecamp development roadmap.
- **AI: Cutting-edge AI-powered capabilities**
- **Firecamp CLI:** developer-friendly CLI tool

## Getting the most of Firecamp
üìô [Documentation](https://firecamp.io/docs)

See the Firecamp doc for in-depth walk-throughs on functionality. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8hRaqhK) if you need help, want to chat, or are thinking of a new feature. We're here.

## Philosophy
The decentralization of tools, processes, and people creates friction in API development workflow and frustration across the team. Developers are constantly switching between tools, searching for information, and wasting time due to inefficient tools.
We believe that the existing solution lacks both world-class experience and the simplicity needed to build APIs faster. This leads to a decrease in developer productivity, slow release times, and poor team collaboration.
We are bringing the VS code philosophy to Firecamp to solve this critical problem. Our mission is to build the most extensible, minimal and best developer experience API platform where developers feel most productive while building APIs.

## What's cool about this?

Firecamp is a Multi-protocol API platform, which offers end-to-end testing and development of Rest, GraphQL, WebSocket, and many other APIs.
We support major API specifications and protocols, which allows for seamless API testing, API documentation, and smoother collaboration between backend, frontend, and mobile teams.

## What's Next? 
**OpenSource**, We are excited to announce it, Firecamp Open Source will be released soon. Keep watching this repo for further updates.

 *Together, let's elevate the way we test, develop, and conquer APIs!* üöÄ
